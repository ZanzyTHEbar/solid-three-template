# solid-three

[![pnpm](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20with-pnpm-cc00ff.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=pnpm)](https://pnpm.io/)

Solid-three is a port of [React-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) to [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/),
originally created by [Nikhil Saraf](https://github.com/nksaraf).
It allows you to declaratively construct a [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
scene, with reactive primitives, just as you would construct a DOM tree in SolidJS.
